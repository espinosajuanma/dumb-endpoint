# Branch `006`

## Welcome to the internet

We are going to make our first HTTP Request to an external service.

We need to make an [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) to get info about the comic
of the day or an specific comic.

For this we are going to use the `endpoint.httpModule` library. Which is
just an `axios` instance.
